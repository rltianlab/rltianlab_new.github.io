    We developed [website](http://www.crisprbrain.org/) to discover the data commons for functional genomics screens in differentiated human cell types. Such screens can query a large set of genes (such as all ~20,000 protein-coding human genes) for their contribution to a cellular function of interest. These provide an overview of different modes of screening and highlights examples of recent CRISPR screens with relevance to neurological disease.

    Tian et al. presented a CRISPR interference-based platform for genetic screens in human iPSC-derived neurons in the previous [research](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2019.07.014). This platform enables systematic elucidation of gene function in human neurons and reveals neuron-specific roles of genes for survival, transcriptomics states, and morphology.
